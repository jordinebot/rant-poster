# Rant Poster

## About devRant
[devRant](https://www.devrant.io/) is an amazing growing community of fellow Developers to talk about programming and swearing to projects, bosses, clients, coworkers, interns... If you're a developer and you didn't know about devRant, please make yourself a favor and go get it.

## The poster
[Letmecode](https://www.devrant.io/users/Letmecode) is a pretty famous user in the community well-known for his explicit rants. As a Web Developer, I thought [this rant](https://www.devrant.io/rants/635868/you-know-what-fuck-your-stupid-buggy-masonry-layouts-fuck-your-infinite-scrollin) deserved a poster. So I did it. :/
